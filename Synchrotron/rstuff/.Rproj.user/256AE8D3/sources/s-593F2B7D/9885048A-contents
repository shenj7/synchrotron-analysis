This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
sampleData = read.table("sample1_spot1_000.r", header = FALSE, sep = "", skip = 0)

plot(sampleData,
     main = "Sample 1 Spot 1",
     type = "l",
     xlab = "Energy (eV)",
     ylab = "Absorbtion",
     yaxt='n')

#use lines() command to overlay lines - plot known sample data etc
#also legends

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
